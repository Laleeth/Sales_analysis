##### Problem Statement
E-commerce (electronic commerce) is the purchasing and selling of products and services, as well as the transmission of payments and data, over an electronic network, most commonly the internet. These Business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer (B2C), consumer-to-consumer (C2C), and consumer-to-company (C2B) transactions are the four types of business transactions.

##### Scenario in Business
An online e-commerce company's analytics team wants to create a sales dashboard to examine sales across multiple product categories. The company intends to provide users more flexibility over product categories, so they can choose a category and view the trend month by month and product by product.
In addition, the Analytics team wishes to construct a histogram to examine the number of shipment days.
